Here's an outline for a **side project** that performs **live sentiment analysis on news related to stocks** using **LLMs, NumPy, and pandas**. This can be a valuable tool for understanding market sentiment and can evolve into a more advanced financial analytics platform.

## ðŸ“Š Stock News Sentiment Analysis â€“ Side Project Outline

### ðŸ§  Goal:

Build a tool that fetches live news about selected stocks, analyzes the sentiment using an LLM (e.g., OpenAI GPT), and presents insights using NumPy and pandas for processing and aggregation.

---

## 1. **Project Setup**

* **Tech Stack**:

  * Python
  * NumPy, pandas
  * LLM API (e.g., OpenAI GPT or Claude)
  * News API (e.g., NewsAPI, Finnhub, Alpha Vantage)
  * (Optional) Streamlit or Dash for frontend

* **Environment**:

  * Create virtual environment
  * Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install numpy pandas openai requests
    ```

---

## 2. **Stock Selection**

* Input: List of stock tickers (e.g., AAPL, TSLA, MSFT)
* Optional: Pull from an index (e.g., top 10 in S\&P 500)

---

## 3. **News Aggregation**

* Use a news API to fetch real-time news headlines and summaries for each ticker
* Output: pandas DataFrame with columns:

  * `ticker`
  * `title`
  * `summary`
  * `published_at`
  * `source_url`

---

## 4. **Sentiment Analysis using LLM**

* Define a prompt template:

  ```
  "Analyze the sentiment of the following news headline and summary about {ticker} stock. Label it as Positive, Negative, or Neutral and explain briefly:\n\nTitle: {title}\nSummary: {summary}"
  ```

* Use the LLM to extract:

  * Sentiment label (Positive, Neutral, Negative)
  * Confidence (if supported)
  * Rationale (optional)

* Append result to the DataFrame:

  * `sentiment_label`
  * `llm_commentary`

---

## 5. **Data Aggregation with pandas & NumPy**

* Group by `ticker` to compute:

  * Sentiment score (e.g., +1 for Positive, 0 for Neutral, -1 for Negative)
  * Rolling average of sentiment
  * Most frequent sentiment
* Create summary DataFrame:

  * `ticker`
  * `avg_sentiment_score`
  * `latest_sentiment`
  * `news_count`

---

## 6. **Basic Output/Reporting**

* Print or save a summary table
* Plot sentiment over time (optional with matplotlib or seaborn)
* Export:

  ```python
  df.to_csv("stock_sentiment.csv")
  ```

---

## 7. **(Optional) Frontend with Streamlit**

* Display:

  * Filter by ticker
  * Live update button
  * Sentiment charts

---

## ðŸ§ª Bonus Ideas:

* Compare sentiment vs stock price movement
* Add named entity recognition (NER) to tag executives or events
* Historical backfill with older news

---

Would you like help with some starter code for one of the components (e.g., fetching news, querying the LLM, or building the DataFrame)?
